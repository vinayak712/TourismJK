<p className='text-center leading-relaxed text-lg'>
    The making of Patisa requires precision and patience, as the sugar syrup and besan (gram flour) mixture must be cooked to the perfect consistency. The use of pure desi ghee enhances its aroma and flavor, while nuts like almonds and pistachios add a delightful crunch. Originating from the kitchens of Jammu, Patisa continues to be a symbol of the regionâ€™s rich culinary heritage, enjoyed by generations.
